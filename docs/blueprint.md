## Core Features:

- Photo Upload & Validation: Allows users to upload a photo or capture one via camera, with automated validation of quality, size, and orientation. The images should not be stored.
- Interactive Shopping Cart Integration: Provides direct access to the user's shopping cart, allowing them to drag and drop clothing items (e.g., hats, shirts, pants, jackets) onto the uploaded photo. Users can stack multiple items to test combinations.
- Clothing Selection & Personalization: Enables users to browse and filter a clothing catalog, dynamically select sizes and styles, and interact with a color panel to change the color of the clothing, with the AI updating textures and shadows accordingly. This provides a tool to explore different styles.
- Virtual Try-On Engine: Analyzes the user's silhouette, posture, and body landmarks to generate ultra-realistic images, rendering natural drapes, textures, folds, shadows, and lighting for all clothing items added from the cart. This is an AI feature.
- Visualization & Sharing: Offers instant preview of the final look and allows users to download or share the tested combinations.
